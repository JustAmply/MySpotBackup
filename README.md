# MySpotBackup

This is a working version of the discontinued and unfortunately no longer working [SpotMyBackup](https://github.com/secuvera/SpotMyBackup).

> Backup and Restore your Spotify Playlists and "My Music".
>
> This javascript based app allows you to backup all your playlists and import them in any other Spotify Account. It uses the OAuth-Functionality of Spotify to be able to handle your personal playlists.
>
> In consequence, no credentials or data is stored or processed on the Webserver itself.

This has been hacked together last night so there is a lot of room for improvement, but at least it's working again.

There was a small issue with the authentication process, which i fixed using an express server which was faster for me, for code improvement ideas see below.

## How to use:

1. Clone/Download Repository
2. Install Node.js
3. Run `npm install`
4. Create an app at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/
   - App name : e.g. Michaels SpotMyBackup
   - App description : For backing up my account
   - Website : http://youripaddress:8080
   - Redirect URIs : http://youripaddress:8080/callback
   - In the User Management, add your second (new/old) account as well
     - Second user might need to login into dashboard one time as well to confirm terms and conditions
5. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the values (at minimum `CLIENT_ID` and `PUBLIC_URI` to match your deployment); the frontend reads these via the server so no additional config.js is needed
6. Run `npm run dev` to start the Express server
7. Click Login on old account
8. Export File
9. Open in incognito window
10. Click login on new account
11. Import File
12. Done

## Docker

Build and run locally:

```
docker build -t myspotbackup .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env myspotbackup
```

Make sure the URLs in your `.env` match how you expose the container (e.g. `PUBLIC_URI=http://localhost:8080`).

## Development

- Lint the project: `npm run lint` (uses ESLint across both the frontend JS and server code).

## Known Issues (probably already in the original):

- When running this on my personal account, some of the playlists were not copied fully, some were empty on the target, but it was a good start.
- Dates like the time a song was added to a playlist get lost

## Contributing:

Some ugly code here:

- we could integrate the express server functionality into the main index.html again to reduce the dependency
  - we could propose using simply http-server as dependency while still allowing other web servers
- we could use typescript instead of js
- we could properly separate html, css and js
- we could host it online (github deploy actions etc.)
- we could merge [open pull request](https://github.com/secuvera/SpotMyBackup/pulls) features and improvements from the original page
- we could use different scopes (read/write) for the different actions (export only needs reed permission from spotify)
- we could catch some common errors to provide help instead of crashing

## FAQ

- Can i use localhost instead of `youripadress`?: Yes, just use any available hostname. Make sure to also use it inside the Spotify dashboard. The only thing not working should be file:// urls.
